Description: Estimating Point of Departure (POD) from dose-response data using 
    spline meta-regression. GRAVEE uses bootstrap resampling on dose-response
    data and spline meta-regression to fit dose-response curves. Menger
    Curvature is used to estimate Points of Departure on the simulated dose-
    response curves. GRAVEE returns a 95% interval for POD estimates for
    a chemical.
